            <h4>Terms of Use</h4>
            <br>
            <p>This Agreement was last revised on April 28, 2021.</p>
          <p>
              <p>
                Welcome to Goodreads.com, the website and online service of Goodreads LLC (together with its <br>affiliates, "Goodreads" "we," or "us"). This page explains the terms by which you may use our service.<br> By accessing or using the Goodreads services, website and software provided through or in connection <br>with the service ("Service"), you agree on behalf of yourself and all members of your household and <br>others who use this Service under your account ("you" or "your") to be bound by this Terms of Use <br>Agreement, the Goodreads Privacy Policy, the Amazon.com Conditions of Use, and the other applicable<br> rules, policies and terms posted on the Goodreads.com website or provided with the Service <br>(collectively, this "Agreement"), whether or not you are a registered user of our Service.
              </p>
               
              <p>
                We reserve the right to amend this Agreement at any time in our sole discretion by posting the revised<br> Agreement on the Goodreads.com website. Your continued use of the Service after any such changes<br> constitutes your acceptance of the revised Agreement. This Agreement applies to all visitors, users, and<br> others who access the Service ("Users").
              </p>
            </p>
            
            <h4>1. Use of Our Service</h4>
            <p>
                <p>Goodreads provides a place for you to discover, track, and talk about books with friends and our <br>community.</p>

                <p>
                  You do not have to register in order to visit Goodreads. To access certain features of the Service,<br> though, including creating "bookshelves" to organize what you've read, posting book reviews, and<br> commenting on other members' reviews, you will need to register with Goodreads and create a<br> "Member" account. Your account gives you access to the services and functionality that we may<br> establish and maintain from time to time and in our sole discretion.
                </p>

                <p>
                  You may never use another Member’s account without permission. You are responsible for maintaining<br> the confidentiality of your account and password and for restricting access to your account, and you<br> agree to accept responsibility for all activities that occur under your account or password. You agree to<br> notify Goodreads immediately of any breach of security or unauthorized use of your account.
                </p>

                <p>
                  You may change the settings on your My Account page to control your profile and how other members<br> communicate with you. By providing Goodreads your email address you consent to our using the email<br> address in accordance with our Privacy Policy.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Subject to your compliance with this Agreement and your payment of any applicable fees, we grant you<br> a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable license to access and make personal and <br>non-commercial use of the Service. This license does not include any resale or commercial use of any <br>part of the Service, or its contents; any collection and use of any book listings, descriptions, reviews or<br> other material included in the Service; any derivative use of any part of the Service or its contents; any <br>downloading, copying, or other use of account information for the benefit of any third party; or any use<br> of data mining, robots, or similar data gathering and extraction tools. All rights not expressly granted<br> to you in this Agreement are reserved and retained by us or our licensors, suppliers, publishers,<br> rightsholders, or other content providers. No part of the Service may be reproduced, duplicated, copied,<br> sold, resold, visited, or otherwise exploited for any commercial purpose without our express written<br> consent. You may not frame or utilize framing techniques to enclose any trademark, logo, or other<br> proprietary information (including images, text, page layout, or form) of Goodreads without our<br> express written consent. You may not use any meta tags or any other "hidden text" utilizing our name<br> or trademarks without our express written consent. You may not misuse the Service. You may use the<br> Service only as permitted by law. The licenses granted by us terminate if you do not comply with this<br> Agreement.
                </p>

                <p>
                  In order to protect our Members from unsolicited advertising or solicitation, Goodreads reserves the<br> right to restrict the number of communications that a Member may send to other Members in any 24-<br>hour period to a number that Goodreads deems appropriate in its sole discretion.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Goodreads may permanently or temporarily terminate, suspend, or otherwise refuse to permit your<br> access to the Service without notice and liability for any reason, including if in Goodreads' sole<br> determination you violate any provision of this Agreement, or for no reason. Upon termination for any<br> reason or no reason, you continue to be bound by this Agreement.
                </p>

                <p>
                  The Service is subject to scheduled and unscheduled service interruptions. All aspects of the Service are<br> subject to change or elimination at Goodreads‘s sole discretion. You agree that Goodreads will not be <br>liable to you for any interruption of the Service, delay or failure to perform.
                </p>

                <p>
                  You are solely responsible for your interactions with other Goodreads Users. We reserve the right, but <br>have no obligation, to monitor disputes between you and other Users. Goodreads shall have no liability<br> for your interactions with other Users, or for any User’s action or inaction.
                </p>
            </p>

            <h4>2. User Content</h4>
            <p>
              <p>
                Some areas of the Service may allow Users to upload, publish, display, link to or otherwise make<br> available (hereinafter, "post") reviews, comments, questions, highlights, and other information<br> including Users’ names, voices and likenesses ("User Content"). You are solely responsible for your<br> User Content. You agree not to post User Content that is illegal, obscene, threatening, defamatory,<br> invasive of privacy, infringing of intellectual property rights (including publicity rights), or otherwise<br> injurious to third parties or objectionable, and does not consist of or contain software viruses, political<br> campaigning, commercial solicitation, chain letters, mass mailings, or any form of "spam" or<br> unsolicited commercial electronic messages. You may not use a false e-mail address, impersonate any<br> person or entity, or otherwise mislead as to the origin of content. You hereby represent that you are the<br> owner of all the copyright rights with respect to, or that you have the legal right to post, your User<br> Content, and that you have the power to grant the license granted below. Goodreads reserves the right<br> to monitor, reject and/or remove any User Content at any time. For example, Goodreads may, but is not<br> obligated to, reject and/or remove any User Content that Goodreads believes, in its sole discretion,<br> violates these provisions.
              </p>

              <p>
                Goodreads takes no responsibility and assumes no liability for any User Content that you or any other<br> Users or third parties post or send over the Service. You understand and agree that any loss or damage<br> of any kind that occurs as a result of the use of any User Content that you post is solely your<br> responsibility. Goodreads is not responsible for any public display or misuse of your User Content. You<br> understand and acknowledge that you may be exposed to User Content that is inaccurate, offensive,<br> indecent, or objectionable, and you agree that Goodreads shall not be liable for any damages you allege<br> to incur as a result of such User Content. Goodreads may provide tools for you to remove some User<br> Content, but does not guarantee that all or any User Content will be removable.
              </p>
            </p>

            <h4>3. License Grant</h4>
            <p>
              By posting any User Content on the Service, you expressly grant to Goodreads a nonexclusive, royalty-<br>free, perpetual, irrevocable, and fully sublicensable right to use, reproduce, modify, adapt, publish,<br> perform, translate, create derivative works from, distribute, and display such content throughout the<br> world in any media. You represent and warrant that you own or otherwise control all of the rights to<br> the content that you post; that the content is accurate; that use of the content you supply does not<br> violate this policy and will not cause injury to any person or entity; and that you will indemnify<br> Goodreads for all claims resulting from content you supply. If you submit User Content via the “My<br> Writing” or “Ebook” features, our Terms of Use for Writers apply to that User Content.
            </p>

            <h4>4. Our Proprietary Rights</h4>
            <p>
              <p>
                Except for your User Content, the Service and all materials therein or transferred thereby, including,<br> without limitation, software, images, text, graphics, illustrations, logos, patents, trademarks, service<br> marks, copyrights, photographs, audio, videos, music, and User Content (the "Goodreads Content"),<br> and all intellectual property Rights related thereto, are the exclusive property of Goodreads and its<br> licensors. Except as explicitly provided herein, nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to create a<br> license in or under any such intellectual property Rights, and you agree not to sell, license, rent,<br> modify, distribute, copy, reproduce, transmit, publicly display, publicly perform, publish, adapt, edit or<br> create derivative works from any materials or content accessible on the Service. Use of the Goodreads<br> Content or materials on the Service for any purpose not expressly permitted by this Agreement is<br> strictly prohibited.
              </p>

              <p>
                You may choose to or we may invite you to submit comments or ideas about the Service, including<br> without limitation about how to improve the Service or our products ("Ideas"). By submitting any Idea,<br> you agree that your disclosure is gratuitous, unsolicited and without restriction and will not place<br> Goodreads under any fiduciary or other obligation, and that we are free to use the Idea without any<br> additional compensation to you, and/or to disclose the Idea on a non-confidential basis or otherwise to<br> anyone. You further acknowledge that, by acceptance of your submission, Goodreads does not waive<br> any rights to use similar or related ideas previously known to Goodreads, or developed by its<br> employees, or obtained from sources other than you.
              </p>
